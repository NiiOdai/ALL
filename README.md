# Gas Dectector in C++

## What it is

This project contains:
-the gas Sensor(MQ-2 Gas Sensor) senses gas exposed in the environment.
-the buzzer immediately gives an audible bip for some seconds and then buzzes continually in the presence of gas
- the Liquid Crystal Display(LCD) visually notify users of alerts.
-the LCD also display when the environment of the users is safe(i.e when no gas is detected).




## Hardware requirements

*Jumper wires
*220 Ohms resistor
*Arduino UNO R3 

## Software requirements

1. Arduino IDE(We use the arduino IDE to compile our code and upload to the Arduino UNO )
2.Tinkercad(a Web appilication that simulates our project using the source code)
