# Gas Dectector in C++

## What it is

This project contains:
-the gas Sensor(MQ-2 Gas Sensor) senses gas exposed in the environment.
-the buzzer immediately gives an audible bip for some seconds and then buzzes continually in the presence of gas
- the Liquid Crystal Display(LCD) visually notify users of alerts.
-the LCD also display when the environment of the users is safe(i.e when no gas is detected).
 
 **Usage:**
  -Connect the components correctly as shown in the image at the later part of the page.
 -Clone repository in order to alter variable in the sourcecode to suit environment.
 -Just open this ino file with Arduino IDE and upload to the prototype.

Such as the
<b>Liquid Crystal Display Library:</b>

This library allows an Arduino board to control Liquid Crystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs. The library works with in either 4- or 8-bit mode but this project's LCD is in 4-bit mode.


# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate during the group meetings.
## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

<h1>The repository will be maintained by collaboraters.</h1>
## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
